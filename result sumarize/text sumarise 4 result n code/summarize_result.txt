From this experiment, the best model based on keyword score for Thai travel news summarization was SVD with sentence selection by Murray, G. et al. This paper applied a text summarization system for Thai travel news based on keyword scored in Thai language by extracting the most relevant sentences from the original document. Document summarization pipeline based on LSA and NMF S2 For sentence selection by K-means clustering, we grouped similar sentences into the same cluster using the following steps: 1. CCS Concepts • Information systems ➝ Information retrieval ➝ Retrieval tasks and goals➝ Summarization Keywords Text summarization; extractive summarization; non-negative matrix factorization 1. proposed a Thai text summarization that extracted a paragraph from a document based on Thai compound nouns, term frequency method, and headline score for generating a summary. Repeat steps 2-3 until all sentences are assigned to a group, no sentences change the group, or the similarity between sentences and their centroid is close. proposed techniques of text summarization by using word frequency in the document and calculated the weight of word to create a keyword group.
