In this paper, we applied LSA and NMF on the Thai Travel News dataset for calculating the semantic weights, which represented the relationship between sentences and words in order to select the representative sentences for summarization. Thai text summarization efficiency of 5 models Figure 2 shows the Thai text summarization efficiency of 5 models: (1) NMF with GRS, (2) NMF with K-means, (3) SVD with sentence score by Gong, Y. et al., (4) SVD with K-means, and (5) SVD with sentence score by Murray, G. et al. applied to 400 Thai travel news, divided into 5 sets of 80 news each, with the varied compression rates of 20%, 30% and 40%.
