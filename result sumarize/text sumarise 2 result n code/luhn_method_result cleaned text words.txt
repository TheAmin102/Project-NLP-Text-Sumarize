Daily newspaper has abundant of data that users do not have enough time for reading them It is difficult to identify the relevant information to satisfy the information needed by users Automatic summarization can reduce the problem of information overloading and it has been proposed previously in English and other languages However there were only a few research results in Thai text summarization due to the lack of corpus in Thai language and the complicated grammar Text Summarization 1 is a technique for summarizing the content of the documents It consists of three steps 1 create an intermediate representation of the input text 2 calculate score for the sentences based on the concepts and 3 choose important Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page Copyrights for components of this work owned by others than 𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 and both terms are non negative as shown in Eq 2 and Eq 3 4 𝑖𝑖 1 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 𝑛𝑛𝑞𝑞 1 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝 1 𝑛𝑛𝑞𝑞 1 𝐻𝐻𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 5 The 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 is the relative relevance of the ith semantic feature 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 where 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the weight of the topic 𝑖𝑖 in the sentence 𝑞𝑞 and 𝐻𝐻𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 is the weight of the topic 𝑝𝑝 in the sentence 𝑞𝑞 The sentences can be ranked by Generic Relevance Sentence scores Sentences with the maximum score will be selected into the summary 3 5 Cosine Similarity Cosine similarity 18 is a widely used method to measure the similarity between vectors representing the documents The result of cosine similarity is ranging from 0 to 1 If it is closer to 1 that means both vectors are similar Eq 6 and Eq 7 represents the cosine similarity equation where cos θ is the dot product between vectors of sentences
