summarization for Thai language. (5) to select a number of
sentences based on NMF, which got the highest semantic weight

In this paper, we applied several text summarization methods to
Thai Travel News based on keyword scored in Thai language by
extracting the most relevant sentences from the original document.

For sentence selection by K-means clustering, we grouped similar
sentences into the same cluster using the following steps:
1. The value was decided by getting the percentage

Non-negative Matrix Factorization

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a method of matrix
factorization subject to the non-negative constraint. = � � �𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − � 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �

NMF and LSA are both matrix factorization algorithms. 3.5

Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity [18] is a widely used method to measure the
similarity between vectors representing the documents. 3.

PREPROCESSING FOR THAI TEXT

The first step for working with Thai Text is word tokenization. For the Generic Sentence Relevance score, the best F1 score for the
compression rate of 20%, 30%, and 40% was 0.86, 0.78 and 0.68
respectively and the best F1 scores for all compression rates were
from the approach of Murray, G. et al.

dataset for calculating the semantic weights, which represented the
relationship between sentences and words in order to select the
representative sentences for summarization.

𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡(𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 ) As
multiple important sentences could be selected from a more
important concept, Murray, G. et al. outperformed both Gong, Y. et
al. and the GRS method.

 From these experiments, we concluded that keyword
scored calculation by LSA with sentence selection by GRS is the
best algorithm for summarizing Thai Travel News, compared with
human with the best compression rate of 20%.

 The average numbers of sentences per news of the 5 sets
were 21, 16, 15, 13 and 13 sentences, respectively.

 In this experiment, we compared 5
models for 5 rounds with Thai travel news using the compression
rates of 20%, 30% and 40% and reported the rate and method that
produced the best result from the experiment.

 The precision shows the correctness of the
extracted sentences and the recall reflects the number of good
sentences missed by the method.

 In this section, we demonstrate our pipeline (Figure 1) used for text
summarization to generate a summary for a Thai travel news.

 5. Select a sentence with the maximum similarity score with
the centroid of the group and add it into the summary.

 The original matrix A can be separated into three
matrices, where U is the m x r (words x extracted concept) matrix,
V is the n x r (sentences x extracted concepts) matrix, and Σ is the
r x r diagonal matrix, which can be reconstructed to find the original
matrix A. The SVD can be represented in Eq. This research focused on the sentence extraction function based on
keyword score calculation then selecting important sentences based
on the Generic Sentence Relevance score (GRS), calculated from
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF). 3.4 Generic document summarization by
NMF

Lee, J., et al. proposed Eq. In this paper, we deployed cosine similarity to measure the similarity
of sentences in K-means clustering.

 Sentences
with the maximum score will be selected into the summary.

 We concluded that keyword scored calculation by LSA
with sentence selection by Generic Sentence Relevance score by
Murray, G. et al. was the best algorithm while the best compression
rate of all models was 20%, for summarizing Thai Travel News
compared with humans.
 For sentence selection, we used Gong, Y. et al. and
Murray, G. et al. approaches for calculating weight of the sentence
scores then selected sentences with the highest scores into the
summary. Therefore, they proposed
that NMF provided a greater possibility for extracting important
sentences.

 We then evaluated the performance of
text summarization methods which were LSA and NMF by
comparing their results with the summaries manually curated by
two experts from the Faculty of Liberal Arts, Ubon Ratchathani
University.

 This meant 80%, 70% and 60% of the
sentences will be selected into the summary.

sentences from all concepts. This model with the compression rate of 20%
got the highest score because Murray G. et al. method determined
the number of sentences to be extracted from each concept based on
the importance of that concept.
